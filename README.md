# 1st100daysofcode
A challenge that stands for practice coding every day for 100 days.

each folder will containe the day project

the projects will be: web application or problem solving practice

in every project, you will find a result.md that shows the final result of the project.

Also, I am planning to add some other informations like how much time I worked on the project.
